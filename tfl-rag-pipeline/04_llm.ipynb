      "Based on the context of the document \"making-londons-lorries-safer_3.pdf\", I'll answer your question about testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Question:** Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "**Context:** The document discusses the importance of testing in evaluating the performance of Safer System (SAS) solutions for lorries. It highlights the need for both laboratory and real-world testing to ensure that systems perform as expected in various scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **What is the purpose of site testing?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Site testing is important to help validate the results seen in laboratory testing with systems being used in the real world. (making-londons-lorries-safer_3.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Why is it necessary to test systems in a real-world setting?**\n",
      "\n",
      "The laboratory provides a very controlled environment, but external factors like environmental conditions and specific use cases can affect system performance. Site testing allows for an examination of current best practice with regard to sensor locations, HMI types, and in-cab screen fitments. (making-londons-lorries-safer_3.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **What is the role of laboratory testing in evaluating SAS solutions?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboratory testing primarily investigates current systems and provides a controlled environment for testing area coverage. However, it may not capture the full range of scenarios that can occur in real-world use cases. (making-londons-lorries-safer_3.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **What type of testing was conducted on May 10th, 2022?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Site test 1: Site testing of the VUE Scan ultrasonic system was conducted on May 10th, 2022. (6.1 Site test 1 in making-londons-lorries-safer_3.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **How is site testing typically performed?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Site testing involves determining position and speed using a GPS-based measurement system or measuring a suitable movement system for a substitute object (dummy). This can be done with the aid of brated and traceable measuring equipment, markings on the test area and vehicle, and film documentation. (making-londons-lorries-safer_3.pdf)\n",
